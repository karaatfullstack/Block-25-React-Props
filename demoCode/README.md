# Demo Code

Just some simple examples of passing props between components

1. `cd` into demoCode file
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the app

The code you want to review is in `src > assets: App.jsx` and `Pizza.jsx`
- There is commented code in App.jsx - if you uncomment it, you'll be able to see a button and practice `useState` to change the button count. That has nothing to do with the Pizza part, it was just useState review :)
