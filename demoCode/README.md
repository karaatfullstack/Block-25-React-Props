# Demo Code

Just some simple examples of passing props between components

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run build`
3. Run `npm run preview` to start the Vite app

The code you want to review is in src > assets: App.jsx and Pizza.jsx
- There is commented code in App.jsx - if you uncomment it, you'll be able to see a button and practice useState to change the button count. That has nothing to do with the Pizza part, it was just useState review
